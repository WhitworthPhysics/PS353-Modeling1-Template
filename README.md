# PS353 Modeling 1

In this series of exercises you will learn how to model one-dimensional motion. The case to be studied is a high altitude drop. The models you use will grow in sophistication.

1. Free fall assuming constant gravitational force
2. Free fall using altitude-dependent gravitational force
3. Falling using altitude-dependent gravitational force and quadratic air drag
4. Falling using altitude-dependent gravitational force and quadratic air drag that accounts for altitude-dependent air density
